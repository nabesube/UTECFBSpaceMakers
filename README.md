Challenge: Outfitting a Mars Habitat: A 3D Print Challenge

"Imagine you’re an astronaut who has newly arrived on the Red Planet. Your habitat has been pre-constructed for you, but, other than three 3-D printers, it doesn’t have most of the things you need to live and work. Your challenge is to design tools, furniture, and other items to assist you on your one-year mission."
