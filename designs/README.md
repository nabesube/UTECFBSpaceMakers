# Designs

In this folder you will find diverse designs, editable and STL created during the SpaceApp process with the help of open data and resources about the missions, materials and habitat that will be used on Mars.

We encourage the use of OnShape: https://www.onshape.com/en/, especially to students, to make 3D design easier and faster.

We focus on designing modular and multipurpose equipment as well as a spare wheel for our rovel, with the least amount of material possible. In the future it would be interesting to use generative design to improve the design process of different instruments, equipment and furniture. These approaches can also be used to solve problems of lack of equipment, tools, etc. in other environments.
