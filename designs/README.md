# Designs

In this folder you will find diverse designs, editable and STL created during the SpaceApp process with the help of open data and resources about the missions, materials and habitat that will be used on Mars.

We encourage the use of OnShape: https://www.onshape.com/en/, especially to students, to make 3D design easier and faster.
